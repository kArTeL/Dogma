Dogma
=====

Dogma provides on demand dog walking for the busy dog owner. Dog owners simply enter their desired pickup time, location, and walk duration; and Dogma connects them with a vetted and screened dog walker. The walker will check in with you regularly throughout the walk so you always know where your dog is and when he or she is back home safely. Stuck at the office or getting lucky on a first date? Dogma lets you come home late.
